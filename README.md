# ☕ Java Design Patterns (GoF) — AU_CCE Term 5 (Programming II)

A clean, runnable collection of **Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns** implemented in **Java**, organized by category (**Creational / Structural / Behavioural**) with simple demo runners.

---

## ✅ Patterns Covered

### Behavioural
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Iterator**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**

### Creational
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Factory**
- **Prototype**
- **Singleton**

### Structural
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

---

## 🚀 Running the Demos
### In NetBeans
1. Expand the pattern package (e.g., `Behavioural/Strategy`)
2. Open the `*Demo` class
3. **Right-click → Run File**
> All Demos implement Runnable interface, for future menu implementation

---

## ✍️ Conventions used
- `Demo.java` provides a common structure for consistent execution
- Patterns are separated by category and kept in their own packages
- Naming is kept straightforward (e.g., `Context`, `State`, `Strategy`, `Factory`, etc.)
